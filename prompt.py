LLM_GUESS_PROMPT = """
You are playing Wordle, a game where you must guess a hidden 5-letter English word. After each guess, you receive structured feedback for each letter:

- "correct"  ‚Üí the letter is in the correct position (like a green tile)
- "present"  ‚Üí the letter is in the word, but in a different position (like a yellow tile)
- "absent"   ‚Üí the letter is not in the word at all (like a gray tile)

Your goal is to discover the hidden word in 6 guesses or fewer. You should reason strategically and avoid random guessing.

Here is your strategy guide:

1. **Start Strong with a High-Value Opener**
   Begin with a word that contains the most common letters in English. Good starters are:
   - SLATE, CRANE, AUDIO, RAISE, SOARE, ALERT

   These words test a variety of vowels and common consonants to maximize information gained.

2. **Understand the Feedback**
   After each guess, interpret the feedback list:
   - If a letter is marked "correct", always reuse it in the same position in future guesses.
   - If a letter is "present", include it again, but avoid placing it in the same position.
   - If a letter is "absent", avoid using it again ‚Äî unless that letter appears multiple times and may be partially correct.

3. **Avoid Redundant Guesses**
   Do not repeat letters that are already confirmed "absent" ‚Äî doing so wastes an opportunity to test new letters.

4. **Maximize Coverage Early**
   For the first 2‚Äì3 guesses, prioritize testing as many new, untried letters as possible ‚Äî even if they are unlikely to be the answer.

   For example, after SLATE, follow up with a word like ROUND or CHIMP to test unused consonants.

5. **Handle Duplicates Carefully**
   Wordle allows repeated letters (e.g., SHEEP, BLOOD, LEVEL). If a letter is marked "present" or "correct" and you suspect it appears more than once, test that in future guesses.

6. **Track Eliminated Letters**
   Keep track of all letters marked "absent" and avoid reusing them unless you're testing for a known duplicate.

7. **Narrow the Solution Space**
   By the 3rd or 4th guess, you should have a partial structure of the word. Use logic to eliminate invalid combinations.

   Example:
   - Guess: SLATE ‚Üí [absent, correct, present, absent, absent]
   - You now know that L is in position 2, and A is in the word but not at position 3. Try placing A elsewhere, keep L fixed, and eliminate S, T, and E.

8. **Respect Position Constraints**
   If a letter has been "present" multiple times but failed in specific positions, focus on the remaining untested positions.

9. **Avoid Obscure or Rare Words**
   Prioritize common English words likely to be used in Wordle. Avoid obscure, outdated, or ultra-rare words.

10. **Endgame Logic**
    If you have confirmed 3‚Äì4 letters by guess 5, use logic to permute the remaining structure. Focus on untested positions or substitutions with similar words.

### Feedback Interpretation Example:

Target Word: PLANK  
Guess: SLATE  
Feedback: ["absent", "correct", "present", "absent", "absent"]

Explanation:
- S is not in PLANK ‚Üí "absent"  
- L is at the correct position (2nd) ‚Üí "correct"  
- A is in the word, but not in position 3 ‚Üí "present"  
- T and E are not in PLANK ‚Üí "absent"

Use this logic on your previous guesses to eliminate wrong letters and improve your next one.

---

### Output Instructions:
- Respond with only your next guess as a single uppercase English word.
- Do not explain your reasoning.
- Do not reuse a previously guessed word.
- Do not use letters marked "absent" unless testing a duplicate.
- Do not include any punctuation or comments.

---

### Example-Based Reasoning Guide:

1. **Feedback:** ["absent", "correct", "absent", "absent", "absent"] (from SLATE)  
   ‚Üí Next: **ROUND**  
   ‚úÖ Tests unused letters, keeps L fixed  
   ‚ùå Avoid: **LEAST** (reuses known absents)

2. **Feedback:** ["absent", "present", "absent", "present", "absent"] (from CHAIR)  
   ‚Üí Next: **THING**  
   ‚úÖ Moves H/I to new positions, introduces new letters  
   ‚ùå Avoid: **HAIRS** (same positions, repeats absent letters)

3. **Feedback:** ["correct", "correct", "absent", "absent", "absent"] (from PLANT)  
   ‚Üí Next: **PLUMB**  
   ‚úÖ Keeps known correct P/L in place  
   ‚ùå Avoid: **PLANT** again

4. **Feedback:** ["present", "present", "absent", "absent", "absent"] (from BLOOD)  
   ‚Üí Next: **BLANK**  
   ‚úÖ Repositions B/L, avoids O/D  
   ‚ùå Avoid: **BLOOM** (repeats O which was absent)

LLM_IMAGE_FEEDBACK_PROMPT = """
You are analyzing a screenshot of the Wordle game board.

Your job is to extract the **entire game state** so far by reading each guessed row and the tile colors.

A tile can be:
- "correct" ‚Üí the letter is green (correct position)
- "present" ‚Üí the letter is yellow (in the word, wrong position)
- "absent"  ‚Üí the letter is gray (not in the word)

---

üîÅ Output Format:
Respond with a Python dictionary **exactly** in the following structure:

{
  "guesses": [ "SLATE", "CLEAN", ... ],
  "results": [
    ["absent", "correct", "present", "absent", "present"],
    ["correct", "correct", "correct", "correct", "absent"]
  ],
  "keyboard": {
    "A": "correct",
    "B": "empty",
    "C": "correct",
    ...
    "Z": "empty"
  },
  "llm_round": 2,
  "last_guess": "CLEAN"
}

---

‚úÖ Requirements:
- List all previous guesses from top to bottom of the board.
- Match each guess with its exact feedback result.
- Build a virtual keyboard status by combining all feedback:
  - If a letter is ever "correct", mark it "correct".
  - Else if "present", mark it "present".
  - Else if "absent", mark it "absent".
  - Otherwise, mark it "empty".
- Set "llm_round" to the number of guesses.
- Set "last_guess" to the most recent word guessed.

üìå Notes:
- Do not include the target word, even if visible.
- Do not include explanations.
- Only return a **valid Python dictionary** exactly in the format above.
